# 60-days-of-kata
Here I'll upload some solutions to the 60 days of kata challenge by [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard). I gotta warn you about these two things:
1. Everything is solved on C++.
2. I'm focused on thinking algorithms rather than just using C++ functions to achieve a short answer.

## Little bit bout me
I'm just a bored student who wants to get better at coding by just having fun.
